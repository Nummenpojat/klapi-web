Klapi is an open source application that is meant to be used in scout activities.
It is developed by scout group Hyvinkaan Nummenpojat. It has web- and Android-version.

Klapi's main use is scout camps where you can do multiple things with this software.
One of uses is locating users during events on scout - only in scout, of course, we don't follow people on their home.
Another use is in programme, in app, a group leader can assign small tasks for youth. These tasks give points and eg. competitions can be organized through them.
It can also be used to mark scouts who participate in programme.

Klapi is fully open source, and it's API is too. API has it's own documentation.
